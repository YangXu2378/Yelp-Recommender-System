The person that answered the phone, Angela was very abrasive from the beginning and told me that my receipt did not reflect that I ordered hummus. I told her it must have been an error because I did click the button on the Yelp app. And she was very adamant and forceful about the fact that I did not order hummus and she could send me a copy of the receipt if I didn't believe her. Snarky!\n",

I explained to her I'm in bed not feeling well. I didn't cook dinner I didn't want to go out of my house that's why I spent 40 plus dollars on food delivery. She was very curt and told me know they have a $10 minimum order and that they will not deliver it. I said you know this isn't about policy Angela this is about customer service it was an error and I'm asking you if I can please buy some hummus and she flat refused to sell me hummus unless I came and picked it up myself.\n",

The oysters were extremely fresh, perfectly chilled, and we didn't receive any of the overly large ones that can at times be unappetizing. We started out with two glasses of wine, a dozen oysters, 2 orders of the steak tartar bites ($6 each during happy hr), and an order of hummus that was complimentary with a yelp check-in. Everything was perfect. We opted to sit on the patio since the weather was as perfect as it could possibly be, and ended up deciding to get another 2 glasses of wine, with an additional dozen oysters. \n",

There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing.

      "Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!\n",

So upon entering the buffet there was no line or wait. Hostess was nice giving us the once around tour because it was our 1st time. The food looked incredible and my mouth was salivating to try it all. I'm the type of person that my first go round is to try it phase then the next time , and the next time I Attack !! Steak and eggs were bomb , omelet was on hit too. Red velvet pancakes yum . Had problems with the country fried potatoes but the onion rings made up for it.                                             Not a big fan of the champagne and orange juice so I instead opted to order the bottomless beer  Yeee !! Sea food was incredible and made sure I did damaged there also. Made a pit stop for the food truck type tacos . Brought it home with the desserts ! Well rounded buffet really , really enjoyed it . Some yelpers I see complained about $$ it's well wort it !! Will come back !!\",\n",
       "       \"This buffet is amazing.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth the splurge.  I recommend that you look at everything first and then decide what to get, because you can't possibly try everything.  I missed an entire corner of great food that I didn't see at first, and then I was too full to eat more. I like how everything is on little plates, bowls, or baskets, so everything doesn't get mixed together.  Lines are long, but you can check in and then they text when your time is almost up.  The wait time was less than they had said it would be, so don't go far away to wait.\",\n",

But for 50 something dollars for dinner was not worth it....Sorry but if I could choose another place to spend that much I know I would have been much happier. Not to mention they took a photo of us when we came in then brought us like 3-4 printouts of them, I mean nice ones...then they told us it was 15 dollars for one of the pictures...we honestly thought out of all the money we spent we\\'d at least get the pics for \"free.\"  So they went through all the trouble to print them and then are going to throw them away because we didn\\'t want to pay for them? Why not just give us the photos...Food was cold, poor quality of meats, etc..Also not near as big as this looks! Just bummed we spent so much. \\nSorry can\\'t recommend this at all.'],\n",

      "We heard a lot about this place, both good and bad.  So we decided to try the place.  First of all, the buffet is located inside the Ceasar's Palace Hotel and Casino, not at the Forum. If you are driving to the hotel,  prepare to look for the closest valet as there are at least 4 or more valets at this hotel.  Once we got to the restaurant, there was a long line, as expected.  Since there were 7 of us, we were directed to another line  for parties of 6 or more. We didn't wait that long before we were finally seated.  I was not really impressed with the ambiance.  The space looked really cramped, the table we sat at wasn't steady and kept rocking, it was not what I had expected.  Once we were seated, we waited about 10-15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  The food was not as great as I expected it to be. They had an Asian buffet line which consisted of various dumplings and shumai, the usual noodles and fried rice along with spring rolls.  Variations of sushi and soup.  The usual BBQ and pizza line and of course , if you're craving for Mexican food, they have a variety of that as well.  If you're into seafood like I am, I went straight for  the crab legs and fresh oysters.  They we actually good size crab legs. The oysters  tasted fresh.  I think the best part of the buffet was their desert line. From cake pops to Creme Brûlée and ice cream to Asian sesame Mochi balls.  Our waitress, Milka, was very nice and even brought my daughter a birthday plate full of deserts. Overall,  the food was okay.  Not as spectacular as I thought it would be.  Dinner starts at 52.99 per person. So if you're a light eater, may as well eat someplace to get your money's worth.\n",
      " 4 -\n",
      "People have claimed Bacchanal as the best buffet in Vegas, but I don't really think so. They have great selection, but they lack in taste in a lot of areas. I don't mind coming here because it isn't bad, and because of the huge variety, I can usually find a handful of things I like. The price is on the high side and I'll never eat my money's worth here for sure. They don't really have discounts here either unless you do the Buffet of Buffets 24hr deal, which I have done on occasion and pay an additional $20 for the Bacchanal add-on. Line is long at night, but they have a tablet for you to leave your phone number and they will text you when you are up.\n",
      "I came here this past April for the early bird weekday brunch special ($30 before 9am), but I think the promotion might be over now.\n",
      "Although I didn't really need to use it this last time, I have a Diamond players card. I pay a heavy premium for this membership....and thus I can skip the buffet line at all Caesar's entertainment hotels if I want to.\n",
      "I didn't see any prime rib for the brunch, and was pretty disappointed with that. I just went around picking up whatever looked good. \n",
      "I'm not even Chinese, but stay away from the Chinese food. At least not the chow fun or fried rice. Honestly I can make better chow fun and friend rice at home and it turns out pretty bad when I do.....so yeah that says a lot about their food.\n",
      "Dessert selection is quite nice, but I didn't see the cakepops I really like the last time I came. Maybe it's a dinner thing only. I did leave with some gelato though.\n",
